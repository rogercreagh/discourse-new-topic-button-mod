# discourse-new-topic-button-mod
 Only places new topic button on topic pages

Modification of the [New Topic Button](https://meta.discourse.org/t/new-topic-button-on-all-pages-theme-component/84551) component.

Original placed new topic button on every page, this modification restricts it to pages where the relevant topic is defined - when viewing a topic or a single category.
Also adds a new topic button at the bottom of a topic next to the blue reply button as a minor prompt to consider whether you are really replying or starting a new thread.
